# Personal-Projects
This repository contains the projects I have enjoyed doing in my free time:
1. A mathematical investigation,
2. A lead tracker chrome extension,
3. A Python program that scraps an Adventure event website for data and stores it in Firebase,
4. A website built for the Bristol Start-up, Space Pride, found at spacepride.space,
5. An application that scraps flight comparison websites to find the cheapest flights.
